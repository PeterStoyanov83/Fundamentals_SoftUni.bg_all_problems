3. Longer Line

You will be given the coordinates of four points. The first and the second pair of points form two different lines.
Create a function that prints the longer line in the format "({X1}, {Y1})({X2}, {Y2})" starting from the point which
is closer to the center of the coordinate system (0, 0). You can reuse the method that you wrote for the previous
problem. If the lines are of equal length, print only the first one. The resulting coordinates must be formatted to
the lower integer.
